This program uses Jasmine (http://jasmine.github.io/) to test functionality for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.  To begin, download all files.  Use a web browser to open index.html.  The RSS feed will open and, in the bottom of the page, are the results of the jasmine tests.  Completed as part of course at Udacity.com.
